When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work locally?
	to save my repository online and to share my work with others so others can contribute to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	you might not want the changes in GitHub to be in your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks when you want to a repository in github that you don't have authority to change it
	clones when you have a repository in github you want it locally
	branches when you locally you want to make changes but without involving master with it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	to keep track of the last known position in repository and to help github merge
	your branch with the repository branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	you make a branch then make your changes push the branch into the github repository and then make
	a pull request.
	easy to make changes in github but harder if there are conflicts between the pull request.
