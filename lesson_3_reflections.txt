When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work locally?
	to save my repository online and to share my work with others so others can contribute to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	you might not want the changes in GitHub to be in your local repository
