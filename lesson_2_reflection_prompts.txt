What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


	git creates a .git file, I need to do it to keep track of the files

	I want in this directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	staging area differs from working directory in that it only holds the initial BUNDLES

	of RELATED files to track together in order to commit them later.

	it is necessary to commit changes to related files with a ONE logical change

	//modified

	the staging area holds the changed files before commiting them its like a buffer

	so you can check the modified files in it before commiting them
	also it is used to make sure you have one commit per logical change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	you only add the files related to that logical change to the staging area

	then you commit these files.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized?How would branches help?

	you might be able to merge them later


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	
	I don't know what to say it just helps!


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in 
the diagram the way we do?


	the result is a new commit that will have the both changes, the new commit will have

	two parents this why we represented it that way.


What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	automatic is faster, but sometimes there will be conflicts so you have to merge them

	manually.
